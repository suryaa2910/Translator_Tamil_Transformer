Tamil is a language spoken predominantly by the Tamil people of India and Sri Lanka, as well as by Tamil diaspora communities around the world. It is one of the oldest classical languages in the world, with a rich literary tradition dating back over two millennia. Tamil has a unique script, which is syllabic in nature and consists of characters representing consonants and vowels.

The language has a wide range of dialects, with variations in pronunciation, vocabulary, and grammar across different regions. Modern Tamil is divided into two main dialects: the one spoken in Tamil Nadu, India, and the other spoken in Sri Lanka. Despite these variations, speakers from different regions can generally understand each other.

A Tamil translator created using transformer models leverages advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques to facilitate accurate translation between Tamil and other languages.
